The Settlement Leader can choose a guild to enter if they know the guild name and the password for that particular guild. If you want to make a guild, simply go to the guild center. Anyone can make a guild but only a Settlement Leader can join a guild. For the alpha game, there is settlement guilds, meaning, when a settlement leader joins the guild, the whole settlement joins the guild. Guild Leaders DO NOT have to be a Settlement Leader, but can if they want to.
