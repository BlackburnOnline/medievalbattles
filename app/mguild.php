The settlement leader can choose a guild to enter if they know the guild name and the password for that particular guild.  If you want to make a guild, simply go to the guild center.  Anyone can make a guild but only a settlement leader can join a guild.  For the alpha game, there is settlement guilds, meaning, when a settlement leader joins the guild, the whole settlement joins the guild.
<br><br>
Settlements can be kicked from guilds by the guild leader.  The Guild leader can also change the password of the guild as well.
