			<br><br><blockquote>  It is imperative for you to read the rules. If you break any of these rules, you could be booted from the game or even banned from Medieval Battles completely. Please follow these rules.<br><br>
  
		<ol>
			<li>You are only permitted one account. <br><br>
			<li>Acceptable language must be used. Some younger people may play this game and we do not want them to be exposed to swearing even if they hear it all the time. Medieval Battles will not be corrupted like so many other things. If you do that kind of stuff, and you do not listen to our warning(s), you will be banned.<br><br>
			<li>Spamming the forums, or other players in the game is not allowed.<br><br>
			<li>You can ONLY log into your own account. If someone goes away on vacation, you are NOT allowed to manage their account. If we find out you are managing someone elses account, both accounts will be deleted.<br><br>
			<li>Deleting and recreating for whatever reason you have, is not allowed. When you sign up, you must make sure all of your info is the way you want it.<br><br>
