        Medieval Battles is a text-based online game that is based off of the AD&D rules.  You can choose from 5 different races and 4 different classes, each having their own advantages and disadvantages.  Ticks run at every half hour, making the game more enjoyable since you don't have to wait an hour to see the updates like other games.
