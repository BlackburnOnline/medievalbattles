        Welcome to Medieval Battles!  Medieval Battles is an online game derived from AD&D rules.

		<br><br>
		Do not worry about the 50 player limit.  It is only for the first game and as a new game starts, the player cap will increase.  We are setting the 50 player limit so that we can find bugs faster and efficiently.  Having too many players, the game will be harder to manage with all the bugs, if we do have alot of bugs.
		<br><br>
		The manual needs to be updated and before the game's release, it will be updated.  When it's updated, please read it before signing up.  It will answer alot of your questions.</font>
