<br><br>	<font class=b3><br>
        Medieval Battles is a text-based online game that is based off of AD&D. You can choose from 5 different races and be 1 of 4 different classes. Each class has it's own set of advantages and disadvantages. Train your civilians into recruits. Train your recruits into your army. You can train wizards, warriors, priests and archers then go out and conquer more land/mountains to expand your empire. You can even explore for land/mountains too.
		<br><br>
		Join guilds, or make your own guild and go up agaisnt other guilds. Or you can just sit back and watch your guild grow. Build better and stronger weapons to equip your troops with. Research new spells for your wizards to cast in battle. Make friends or enemys and show everyone else what you are really made of!!
		<br><br>
		What would a medieval-based game be without trading!? If you have too much of something and need more of something else then just barter (trade) with another empire from the game.
		<br><br>
		Medieval Battles is a fast-pased game, and very fun to play. Unlike most games' ticks, our ticks run every 30 minutes. Making the game a lot more enjoyable. Troops build in 1 hour so you don't have to wait forever to get them done. Then in the following tick, you can send them out to conquer other empires!
