At the military page, you are able to: recruit Civilians, Train Recruits into Warriors, Wizards, Priests and Archers(if you have researched them); build new weapons and armor; equip Warriors/Wizards/Archers with Weapons/Magic and Priests with Weapons/Armor.
<br><br>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Recruit Civilians</b>-Civilians by themselves do not do much, but you can train them to learn more advanced techniques. 
<br><br>
	<li><b>Training Recruits</b>-You can train your civilians that have been recruited into warriors, wizards, priests, archers (if archery is researched), explorers, scientists or thieves.
<br><br>
	<li><b>Construct Weapons</b>-If you have enough resources, you can build new weapons to equip your units with. 
<br><br>
	<li><b>Equip</b>-You can equip your units with armor and weapons (spells if the unit is a wizard).
<br><br>
	<li><b>Construct Armor</b>-If you have enough resources, you can build armor to equip your units with.

<br><br>
	
	<li><b>Units</b>

	<ul>
	<li><b class=other>Warrior</b>-Warriors are very strong and agile.  They can use all weapons and all types of armor.  The warriors default armor is studded leather armor.  Warriors don't die as easily as the other units do.
<br><br>
	<li><b class=other>Wizard</b>-Wizards are very intelligent yet lacking in defense and offense.  They can only use the robe as its armor.  Wizards only use spells.  Since they are weak, they die more easily than other units.
<br><br>
	<li><b class=other>Priest</b>-Priests are a mediocre unit.  They don't die as easily as mages do but they aren't as powerful as the warriors.
<br><br>
	<li><b class=other>Archer</b>-One of the best units you can get is the archer.  You must research this unit, unless you are a ranger, before you can train archers though.  They use whatever armor the warrior does and they return home quicker than any other unit.  They are very strong.
<br><br>
	<li><b class=other>Explorer</b>-Explorers are sent on exploration missions to gain land or mountains.  
<br><br>
	<li><b class=other>Thief</b>-Thieves are very sly characters.  They are used to gather information on other empires.  You must send more thieves than the other empire has to gather information on them.
<br><br>
	<li><b class=other>Scientist</b>-Scientists are essential for researching topics.  There is a total of 7 topics  all together.  Some classes/races get different numbers of research topics.  The only class that can research all topics is the mage.  Each scientist will gain you 1 research point per tick.
