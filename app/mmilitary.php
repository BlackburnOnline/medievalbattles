			<br><br><blockquote>  
At the military page, you are able to: recruit civilians, train recruits into warriors, wizards or priests, build new weapons and armor, equip warriors/wizards with weapons/magic and priests with weapons.
<br><br>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Recruit Civilians</b>-Civilians by themselves do not do much, but you can train them to learn more advanced techniques. 
<br><br>
	<li><b>Training Recruits</b>-You can train your civilians that have been recruited into warriors, wizards or priests.  Warriors can only wield weapons, wizards are for casting spells, and priests fight too.  Since priests know how to heal, you will not lose as many troops in battle when you send priests with your attacking fleet.
<br><br>
	<li><b>Construct Weapons</b>-If you have enough resources, you can build new weapons to equip your units with.  Note: mages cannot wield weapons.
<br><br>
	<li><b>Equip</b>-You can equip your warriors with weapons/armor and your wizards with magic spells/armor and your priests with weapons/armor. 
<br><br>
	<li><b>Construct Armor</b>-If you have enough resources, you can build armor to equip your units with.  Note: the armor that you build can only be used by your warriors.
