<!-- You can barter(trade) anything that has some value.  You can sell an item, buy an item, or remove an item if it belongs to you.
<br><br>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Selling</b>-You can sell any resources that you have, civilians, soldiers, wizards, mountains and caves.  When you place your item up to barter for, you will ask what you want for in return.  Only when the specified amount that you want is reached, the item will be sold.
<br><br>
	<li><b>Buying</b>-If you would like to buy an item, click 'buy' right beside the item.  If you have what the player requires for the item to be purchased, the transaction will be immediate.  You will receive the item, and the player you purchashed from will receive what they asked for the item.
<br><br>
	<li><b>Removing</b>-If you have an item up on the market that you want to remove, click 'remove' right beside the item.  Note: If you do not own the item on the market the 'remove' feature will not be there. -->
	Bartering will not be inclued in the alpha game.  Further information will follow once the bartering system has been completed and is ready for future games.
