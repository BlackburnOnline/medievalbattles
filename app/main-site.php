									<hr color=#660000 width=45%>
									&nbsp; &nbsp; Medieval Battles is a text-based online game that is based off of AD&D. You can choose from 4 different races and be 1 of 4 different classes. Each class has it's own set of advantages and disadvantages. Train your civilians into recruits. Train your recruits into your army. You can train wizards, warriors, priests and archers then go out and conquer more land or mountains to expand your empire. You can even explore for land/mountains too.<br>
									<br>
									&nbsp; &nbsp; Join guilds, or make your own guild and go up agaisnt other guilds. Or you can just sit back and watch your guild grow. Build better and stronger weapons to equip your troops with. Research new spells for your wizards to cast in battle. Make friends or enemys and show everyone else what you are really made of!

									&nbsp; &nbsp; We, or I (Mako), promised to bring it back into the v8 engine and that never happened. Well it's not in the v8 engine, but it's v6 in it's old glory, like you remember.<br><br>
									&nbsp; &nbsp; v6: Kupo Remix is going to have bugs and we'll see what we can do to keep them to a bare minimum. Some things probably won't work at all due to us not being able to track down the proper v6 database dump, but again we'll see what we can do to keep that to a bare minimum. You are more than welcome to submit bug reports to support@decoymedia.com. I'd recommend to you that you do not get your hopes up for having immediate bug fixes, or bug fixes at all. The whole purpose of bringing v6 back for right now is to give you all something to do while we finalize Version 8.<br><br>
									&nbsp; &nbsp; So enjoy this piece of nostalgia.<br><br>
