To be able to explore, you have to train your recruits into explorers. You can chose to explore for land, mountains or both. Remember, the more you send on an exploring mission, the more land or mountains you will get. 
	<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Exploring</b>-To see how many explorers you need to get 1 land or mountains an tick, take your current land/mountains and multiply it by .9. Then to see how much land/mountains you get a tick. But if you are a Ranger, take your land and multiply it by .8.
				<br><ul><li><b class=other>The maximum land/mountains you can explore a tick is 20</b></ul><br>

				Example:<br>
				<b class=other>Class=</b>Ranger <br>
				<b class=other>Mountains=</b>288 <br>
				<b class=other>Land=</b>427<br>
				<b class=other>Explorers on Land=</b>200 <br>
				<b class=other>Explorers on Mts=</b> 222<br>

				<br>To find out the amount of explorers you need to get the max amount of land per tick (20 land), you take your land and multilply it by .8, since you are a ranger.  427 * .8 = 342, you would need 342 explorers on land to receive 20 land per tick.  To find out how many explorers it takes to find 1 land per tick, you take 342/20 = 17, so about every 17 explorers, you get 1 land.
				<br><br>To find out the amount of explorers you need to get the max amount of mountains per tick (20 mountains), you take your mountains and multilply it by .8, since you are a ranger.  288 * .8 = 231, you would need 231 explorers on mountains to receive 20 land per tick.  To find out how many explorers it takes to find 1 mountain per tick, you take 231/20 = 12, so about every 12 explorers, you get 1 mountain.
