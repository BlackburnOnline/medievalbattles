To be able to explore, you have to train your recruits into explorers. You can chose to explore for land, mountains or both. Remember, the more you send on an exploring mission, the more land or mountains you will get. 
	<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Exploring</b>-To see how many explorers you need to get 1 land or mountains an tick, take your current land/mountains and multiply it by .9. Then to see how much land/mountains you get a tick. But if you are a Ranger, take your land and multiply it by .8.
				<br><ul><li><b class=other>The maximum land/mountains you can explore a tick is 20</b></ul>
<br><br>
			<li><b>Ending Missions</b>-To cancel explorers, go to the exploring page and click the link above that says 'Cancel Explorers'.  On this page, enter in the amount that you want to cancel from each mission.  Explorers return from their mission instantly.
