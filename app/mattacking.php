Here, you can attack other empires for various things. There are 3 attack types: Land Attack, Mountain Attack and Resource Attack. Note: If you attack successful, you still lose some of your troops, if you fail you lose a greater amount of your troops, that is the difference. Also, if you fail to attack, the empire attacked loses less troops, if you are successful, the empire attacked loses more troops.  You have a maximum of 4 generals.  When you attack, a general is sent out with that party and will return with the troops.  If you have 0 generals, then you must wait for at least one to return before attacking.
<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Land Attack</b>-If you are successful, you will gain 10% of their land. If you fail, you gain no land.
		<br><br>
			<li><b>Mountain Attack</b>-If you are successful, you will gain 10% of their mountains. However, if you fail you will gain nothing.
		<br><br>
			<li><b>Resource Attack</b>-If your attack is successful, you will gain 8% of their gold, iron and civilians. If you fail, you gain nothing.
