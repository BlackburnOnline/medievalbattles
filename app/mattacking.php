Here, you can attack other empires for various things.  There are 3 attack types: Land Attack, Mountain Attack and Resource Attack.  Note:  If you attack successful, you still lose some of your troops, if you fail you lose a greater amount of your troops, that is the difference.  Also, if you fail to attack, the empire attacked loses less troops, if you are successful, the empire attacked loses more troops.
<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Land Attack</b>-If you are successful, you will gain 10% of their land.  If you fail, you will gain no land and they wont lose any of their land.
		<br><br>
			<li><b>Mountain Attack</b>-If you are successful, you will gain 10% of their mountains, however, if you fail you will gain nothing and they will lose nothing concerning their mountains.
		<br><br>
			<li><b>Resource Attack</b>-If your attack is successful, you will gain 10% of their gold, iron and civilians.  If you fail, you gain nothing.
