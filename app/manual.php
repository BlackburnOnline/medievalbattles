			Welcome to the Medieval Battles manual.  Before you play this game, it is recommended that you read this manual.  It might change your mind on how you are going to play the game.<br><br>


The alpha game will most likely include a good number of bugs so please help us by correcting these flaws in the game.  The alpha will be pretty simple because we think its best to start out simple.  Compared to games to come, the alpha is very simple.  You can expect alot more from MB in future games...</blockquote>
