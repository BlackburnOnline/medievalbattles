This code is old, embarassing, buggy and not maintained. We can not say for sure
that it will run well, if at all. This source is being released solely for
historical and educational purposes. If you plan on setting it up, you will need
to edit a few files.

- /gameadmin.php
- /gameconfig.php

The SQL for this version has been lost. If you wish to play Beta 2, you must
fabricate the database from scratch. Or instead, download a different version.
Medieval Battles requires PHP and MySQL.

We are not offering any support on problems with this code, due to its age. If
you need support though, go to the official Medieval Battles Public Forums and
make a request. We are sure some players will gladly be able to assist you.

We also ask you that if you do run a game, let us know. We plan on setting up a
repository with the "Classic" games that are being run. Can't beat free
publicity, eh?
