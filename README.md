This code will NOT run. There is no /include folder. But if you want to attempt
to recreate it all, make sure you edit some pages and upload the database.

- /admin/include/connect.php

To set up the database, run "version4.sql". You will find this file in the /sql
folder. Medieval Battles requires PHP and MySQL.

We are not offering any support on problems with this code, due to its age. If
you need support though, go to the official Medieval Battles Public Forums and
make a request. We are sure some players will gladly be able to assist you.

We also ask you that if you do run a game, let us know. We plan on setting up a
repository with the "Classic" games that are being run. Can't beat free
publicity, eh?
