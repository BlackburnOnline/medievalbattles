This is the first version of Medieval Battles. Debuted on July 11, 2002. The
fact that it is the first version shows how much we have grown. This version
had 3 classes. No, no races. Just classes. Pretty crappy, eh?

I am only releasing this for the hell of it. The code will not run. There is
no database to go with it. This is being released solely for nostalgic purposes.

We are not offering any support on problems with this code, due to its age. If
you need support though, go to the official Medieval Battles Public Forums and
make a request. We are sure some players will gladly be able to assist you.

We also ask you that if you do run a game, let us know. We plan on setting up a
repository with the "Classic" games that are being run. Can't beat free
publicity, eh?
